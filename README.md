# ribonanzaRNA

Instruments: Graphein,Pytorch Geometric
1. Preprocess rna sequence to graph with BPPS as edge features in graph_dataset.py and graph_utils.py
1.1. Done and saved before train for saving time.
2. model files -> model.py,model_2.py
3. trained model(train.py) for 120 epochs, 1 epoch ~20min in RTX3060.
